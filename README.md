# Datamatch Stats 2022 Visualization

Visualization for the 2022 Datamatch website to highlight the difference in matches received based on particular responses.
The link to the repo for the Python script for processing the raw data is here: https://github.com/Hwacha1012/pythonJSONProcessing2.


That repository has a script that outputs the data into a .csv that is compatible with this visualization. When the raw data is received from the 2022 form, pass each school's data through the python script and then upload the resulting csv into this visualization's source code along with the json of the survey questions/answers.

# Changes that need to still be made: 
1. Changing the font to match typical Datamatch fonts (for the title, displayed boxes, and the legend)
